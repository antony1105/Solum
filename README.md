## Question A: Mystic Waves

A mathematical problem involving alternating energy waves. Calculate the total energy after n waves alternating between x and -x.

**Language:** Python  
**Key Concepts:** Mathematical patterns, modular arithmetic

[See detailed README](Question%20A/README.md)

## Question B: CargoCraft Fleet

Determine the minimum and maximum number of crafts needed to achieve a specific total of propulsion units, given two craft types with different unit counts.

**Language:** Python  
**Key Concepts:** Number theory, optimization, divisibility

[See detailed README](Question%20B/README.md)

## Question C: Frontend Login Page

A fully functional login page with client-side validation, password requirements, and responsive design.

**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript  
**Key Features:** Form validation, password visibility toggle, responsive design

[See detailed README](Question%20C/README.md)

## Setup & Running

Each question folder contains its own README with specific setup and run instructions.
