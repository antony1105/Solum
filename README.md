## Question A: Mystic Waves

This one's about calculating energy from alternating waves (x, -x, x, -x...). Pretty straightforward once you spot the pattern.

**Language:** Python  

👉 [Full explanation](Question%20A/README.md)

## Question B: CargoCraft Fleet

Given two types of crafts with different propulsion units, figure out the min/max number of crafts needed for a total. It's basically a number theory problem.

**Language:** Python  

👉 [Full explanation](Question%20B/README.md)

## Question C: Frontend Login Page

Built a working login page with proper validation. No backend needed - everything runs client-side.

**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript  

👉 [Full explanation](Question%20C/README.md)

## Running the Code

Each folder has its own README with details, but here's the quick version:

**Question A & B (Python):**
```bash
cd "Question A"
python questionA.py
```

cd "Question B"
python questionB.py
```

**Question C (Frontend):**
Just open `Question C/index.html` in your browser. That's it!

## Test Accounts (for Question C)

You can log in with any of these:
- `test@example.com` / `Test@1234`
- `admin@example.com` / `Admin@5678`
- `user@example.com` / `User#9876`
